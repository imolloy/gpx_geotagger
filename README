GPX Geotagger

This is a simple python script that geotags photos using GPX data, for example, captured from a Garmin Forerunner watch and exported from Garmin Training Center. 


python geotag.py  -h
Usage: geotag.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --gpx=GPX_FILE        GPX Trackpoint File
  -i INPUT, --input=INPUT
                        Input Directory
  -x, --XMP             Output XML File
  --hours=HOURS         Time Offset in Hours
  --minutes=MINUTES     Time Offset in Minutes
  --seconds=SECONDS     Time Offset in Seconds
  -v, --verbose         Verbose Output

Example
  python geotag.py --gpx foo.gpx --hours 5 --minutes 2 -i /Volumes/Untitled/
  python geotag.py --gpx foo.gpx --hours 5 --minutes 2 ~/Pictures/*.ARW

The --hours, --minutes, and --seconds flags are used for converting the camera time into GPS time (usually GMT). The -i flag will attempt to read all files in the given input directory (non-recursive). Otherwise, it will read all remaining arguments.
